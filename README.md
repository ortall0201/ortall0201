# 👋 Hi, I'm Ortal Lasry

**AI Engineer | GenAI Specialist | LLM Workflow Architect**

I'm passionate about building real-world AI systems that go beyond proof of concept. I specialize in:
- 🔁 Multi-agent orchestration (CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph)
- 🧠 LLM-powered apps and RAG pipelines
- ⚙️ Scalable backends (FastAPI, vector search, cloud-native tools)

---

### 🚀 Latest Project: Agentic AI Chatbot (Internship)
As part of a global collaboration, I co-led development and core architecture for a mental health-focused **Agentic AI assistant**. I managed the product from idea to MVP — now in advanced testing with real users.

📌 Features I built:
- Dynamic prompt routing and semantic memory
- FastAPI backend with user session management
- RAG pipeline using LangChain & embeddings
- Dashboard integration and crisis detection logic
